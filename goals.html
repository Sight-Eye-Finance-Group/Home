    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p>Sight Eye Finance Group™ is a Crypto Structured Pension Fund accessible to anyone regardless of their location or tax bracket; that provides a wide variety of investment targets to investors with different risk profiles. Our approach to creating products
        of value is rooted in the rigorous methods of industrial design and driven by an intense focus on materials, development and craft.</p>
    <p>Whereas traditional investing relies on centralized firms, services, and brokers (along with their fees, rules, and roadblocks), Sight Eye Finance Group™'s DeFi Structure gives you complete freedom to pursue the best investments for you.
    </p>
    <p>We believe society will restructure around blockchain-based incentive systems, and we take pride in accelerating this future by allocating funds towards breakthrough technologies and technical teams building these ecosystems.</p>
    </p>
    In a truly systematic way the study of market price action, volume, and open interest hold the answers to the questions. Price moves in trends and history repeats it's self.
    <p>
        Algorithms need to be tested using the same kind of data they will encounter in actual operation. Your trades can occur seamlessly without user interaction. Investors can capitalize on market trends without having to make those trades themselves.
